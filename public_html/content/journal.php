                <h3>CIT-360 OOP II: Journal</h3>
                    <h4>Week 1 | January 9</h4>
                    <p>I am so excited to get back into coding.  It’s been 
                        almost a year and I love putting together a good, 
                        working program.  However, I’m really nervous about the 
                        other aspects of this class.  If programming really is 
                        the easy part, this could be a tough class for me.  I 
                        am also really anxious about the alternative structure 
                        of this class.  I struggle with online learning in 
                        general – I do really well in a classroom where I can 
                        listen to a lecture, ask clarifying questions, and get 
                        hands-on practice with the instructor.  I am not very 
                        good at teaching myself.  I do feel like I’m getting 
                        much better at group work though, so hopefully that goes 
                        well this semester.﻿</p>
                    <h4>Week 2 | January 15</h4>
                    <p>I had so much fun talking over web app ideas this week.  
                        My husband comes home all the time and says, "You know 
                        what would make a good app?"  He gave me lots of great 
                        ideas, but the one I picked would definitely change my 
                        life the most.  I actually really liked doing the 
                        mock-ups, and I am so looking foreward to starting on 
                        my dynamic project (even if it isn't my idea I'm working 
                        on).  Creating something from nothing is totally 
                        exciting for me!  I'm just eager to get going on the 
                        project planning.</p>
